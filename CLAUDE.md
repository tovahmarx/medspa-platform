## Architecture

- **Static HTML + vanilla JS** — no build step, no framework
- **localStorage** for all data (demo/prototype)
- **Vercel** for hosting (static deployment)
- **hoc-style.css** is the single source of truth for design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing)
- **hoc-sidebar.js** renders the sidebar identically across all pages; app.html intercepts internal links via JS to do SPA navigation
- **hoc.js** contains shared data keys, seed data, formatters, provider/service lists
- **hoc-chat.js** is a self-contained IIFE that injects a floating "?" help widget on every page. Knowledge base is hardcoded — no external API.

## Locations

1. **Old Town — Winfield Scott** (`scottsdale-main`): 4205 N Winfield Scott Plaza, Suite 6, Scottsdale, AZ 85251 — traditional medspa
2. **Old Town — Brown Ave** (`scottsdale-flagship`): 4236 N. Brown Ave, Scottsdale, AZ — surgical, regenerative, stem cell center

Location switcher is in the sidebar. Active location stored in `localStorage('hoc_location')`.

- **Dark accent:** #741450 (burgundy)
- **Signature gradient:** `linear-gradient(135deg, #F00573, #722A82)` — used on all primary buttons
- **Sidebar:** White (#ffffff) with dark text (#1a1814), pink active state
- **Heading font:** Poppins (600 weight)
- **Body font:** Montserrat (400/500 weight)
- **Tagline:** "A Premier Medspa"

## Key Conventions

- CSS variables use `--pri` (pink), `--sec` (purple) prefix system. Legacy `--gold` vars are aliased to `--pri` for backward compat in app.html.
- Provider names do NOT use "Dr." prefix for Sara Ameli (she's a DNP, not MD). Use "Sara Ameli" everywhere.
- Seed data uses `hoc_seed_v3` flag. Bump this when changing seed data structure.
- app.html has its own inline `<style>` block (not using hoc-style.css) because it predates the shared stylesheet. The other pages use hoc-style.css.
- The camera guide overlay uses a `<canvas id="cam-guide-canvas">` with `requestAnimationFrame` loop for real-time drawing. Zone outlines are drawn via canvas 2D context, not SVG.
- The ZONES object in app.html defines silhouette SVGs (`.silhouette` property) for review/compare views, but the live camera uses canvas drawing via `drawGuide()`.
- Consent forms are stored in localStorage key `hoc_consent_forms`. Three seed forms are created on first load.
- Treatment plans are stored in localStorage key `hoc_txplans`.

## Rules

- Every time any feature is added, changed, or removed from the platform, update the knowledge base in hoc-chat.js to reflect the change. This is required on every task — never skip it.
- After every task, always: `git add -A && git commit` with a descriptive message, then `git push org master`, then `vercel --prod`. Never skip the commit, push, or deploy.
